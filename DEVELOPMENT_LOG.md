## Initial Development

### 1. Initial WebSocket Client Request
**Date:** June 26, 2023  
**Time:** 14:32 PST  
**Prompt:**
```
Write a very simple websocket connection class that connects to socket on 12090. Write tests to ensure quality
```

This prompt initiated the development of the WebSocketClient class, which included:
- Creating a TypeScript class that connects to a WebSocket server on port 12090
- Implementing reconnection logic
- Adding event handlers for connection events
- Setting up the project structure

### 2. Test Suite Setup
**Date:** June 26, 2023  
**Time:** 14:45 PST  
**Prompt:**
```
run tests
```

This prompted the setup and running of the Jest test suite, which involved:
- Installing dependencies
- Fixing initial test configuration
- Running the tests to verify functionality

## Bug Fixes and Improvements

### 3. Test Issues and Improvements
**Date:** June 26, 2023  
**Time:** 15:03 PST  
**Actions:**
- Fixed WebSocketServer test issues by simplifying the test approach
- Removed dependency on actual WebSocketServer in tests
- Fixed linter errors in both implementation and test files
- Improved type safety by replacing `any` types with `unknown`

### 4. Documentation Updates
**Date:** June 26, 2023  
**Time:** 15:18 PST  
**Actions:**
- Updated README.md with proper type information
- Enhanced code examples with proper type checking
- Added comprehensive API documentation
- Created example files showing real-world usage with JMRI

### 5. Development Log Creation
**Date:** June 26, 2023  
**Time:** 15:30 PST  
**Prompt:**
```
please create a markdown file and track all the prompts that I use to create this application.
Add the date and time for each prompt
```

This prompt requested the creation of this development log to track the development history.

## Project Maintenance

### 6. Adding Cursor Rule for Log Tracking
**Date:** June 26, 2023  
**Time:** 16:00 PST  
**Prompt:**
```
add a cursor rule that always runs in this code project and updates this file with every new prompt.
```

Created a Cursor rule (.cursor/rules/development-log-tracker.md) that automatically updates the development log with each new prompt. The rule captures:
- Timestamp information (date and time)
- The exact prompt text
- A description of the changes made
- Maintains the chronological order of development steps

This enables automatic documentation of the development process without manual intervention.

## Key Implementation Details

### WebSocketClient Features
- Connects to WebSocket server on port 12090 (configurable)
- Provides event-based API for message handling
- Implements automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Uses TypeScript for type safety
- Includes comprehensive test coverage

### Test Coverage
- Connection/disconnection functionality
- Message sending and receiving
- Error handling
- Event callbacks
- Reconnection logic

### Code Quality
- Linting issues addressed
- Type safety improvements
- Proper error handling
- Clear documentation
- Example usage provided

## Next Steps

Potential future improvements:
- Add authentication options
- Implement protocol versioning
- Add connection state monitoring
- Create higher-level abstractions for specific message types
- Integrate with state management solutions
